This program is a solution to the problem of printing two pyramids with a certain number of lines (SIZE). The user inputs the number of lines for each pyramid and the program prints the desired output.

The program first prompts the user to input a value for SIZE, which is the number of lines for each pyramid. The input is stored in the variable "n". The program then enters a loop that iterates "n" number of times, with each iteration representing a line of the pyramid.

Within the loop, there is a nested loop that prints the necessary number of spaces before each line of the pyramid. The number of spaces decreases as the line number increases. After the spaces are printed, another loop prints the necessary number of "#" characters to complete the line. Finally, a string of two spaces is printed to separate the two pyramids, and another loop prints the necessary number of "#" characters for the second pyramid.

The program then moves on to the next iteration of the outer loop, printing a new line of the pyramid until all "n" lines have been printed.
