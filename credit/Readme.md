# Introduction
This program is designed to check if a credit card number is valid according to the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). It will also print the brand of the credit card if it is valid. The program accepts a single argument, the credit card number, as an input and prints either "INVALID" or the brand of the credit card as an output.
# Implementation Details
The program first prompts the user to enter a credit card number. It then calculates the sum of all the digits according to the Luhn algorithm and checks if the sum is divisible by 10. If it is, the credit card is considered to be valid and the program proceeds to determine the brand of the credit card. If the sum is not divisible by 10, the credit card is considered to be invalid and the program prints "INVALID" and terminates.

To determine the brand of the credit card, the program checks the length of the credit card number and the first digit of the number. Credit card numbers that are 13 digits long and start with a 4 are considered to be Visa cards. Credit card numbers that are 15 digits long and start with a 3 are considered to be American Express cards. Credit card numbers that are 16 digits long and start with a 4 are also considered to be Visa cards, while all other 16-digit credit card numbers are considered to be Mastercard. If the credit card number does not meet any of these conditions, the program prints "INVALID" and terminates.
